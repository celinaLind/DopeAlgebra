# DopeAlgebra (Hackathon Project - AI generated platform) ~ 4 hours
Stay and play on this CoolMath Games Dupe.

Build your dream mini-game with the help up Cat-rina, our dime a dozen AI bot who will produce ready to play code based on your descriptions.

# Used:
This app is 80% AI generated, 10% errors and bugs, and 10% cats o' beautiful cats.

- Tempo Labs AI
  - Assisted in Wireframing and the initial homepage and frontend generation
- Codebuff
  - Assisted in the create game page from coding the AI bot to working on the game previews
- Loading cat

# Challenges
### Lack of Game Development Experience
Do not have previous experience in game development so was unable to appropriately vet and confirm the AI was generated good code. 
### Too much code, not enough eyes
There were times when the bot was updating multiple files and 100s of lines of code. This was a struggle when an error appeared that came from a file that was completely updated instead of being updated in steps.
### Prompting is an art
I should have broken down my prompts into development steps that would allowed for easier code understanding and debugging capabilities.
# Commit Commit Commit
Will never forget to commit changes again. The CodeBuff bot decided it wanted to delete the WHOLE ai-service file except for the SYSTEM_PROMPT it had been requested to update. I luckily had copied it elsewhere for comparison but will make sure to commit when using ai products on production environments.
 
# Future
This is not a funtioning application, it still needs:
- user capabilities
- database
- game feed
- game preview error fix
- game play functionality
